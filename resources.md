# Additional Resources

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions): if you could only have one resource for making browser extensions, this would be it.

MDN's [example WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Examples) are very helpful as a referenceâ€”there are dozens of examples of varying complexity that use different browser APIs.

[Chrome's extension documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) can also be helpful, though if you're using async/await, you'll have to translate the examples from callbacks.
