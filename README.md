# Guide to Browser Extensions

Extensions are bits of code that modify the functionality of a web browser. They are written using standard web technologies - JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - plus some dedicated JavaScript APIs. Among other things, extensions can add new features to the browser or change the appearance or content of particular websites.

This guide discusses some of the basic concepts of building browser extensions and interacting with the browser, and links to resources with more detailed information.
